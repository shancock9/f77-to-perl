TODO list
    This is a list of the most desirable updates to f2perl, in approximate
    order of priority.

  Implement a Semi-Automatic Way to Implement Call Prototypes
    It is very desirable to convert call by reference to call by value
    wherever possible, as this greatly simplifies coding and improves
    robustness. It is very tedious to go through fortran code and determine
    which variables can be converted, so a preliminary pass to do this will
    be very helpful.

    This should also resolve the issue of whether to pass an array as a
    reference to an offset array or as a reference to a scalar.

  Find an Fix all Integer Divides
    This is one of the open bugs, and bad because there is no warning of a
    problem.

  Implement the .eqv and .neqv. Operators
    These are not currently done.

  Expand the Collection of Test Cases and Automate Testing
    Many more are needed to check the parser.
